# 🧠 brain

### Your AI agents have a brain. Now you can *watch it think.*

**brain** turns a [FLUJO](https://mario-andreschak.github.io/FLUJO/githubpages/index.html) workspace into a living neural network —
every flow a glowing neuron, every connection a synapse with signals pulsing along it.
Then it goes further: it **grows autonomous brains** that learn, act, and evolve on their own,
while you watch every thought fire in real time.

*A real FLUJO workspace, live: 25 behaviours, 177 connections, organised into provider galaxies.*

## ✨ What is this?

Agent workflows are graphs. Graphs are boring rectangles on a canvas — until you realise what they actually are: **behaviours wired into a mind.**

**brain** renders that mind. It connects to a running FLUJO instance and builds a 3D universe out of it:

- 🌟 Every flow becomes a **neuron** — sized by complexity, coloured by the model provider it thinks with
- ⚡ Subflow calls become **axons** with signals pulsing from caller to callee
- 🔗 Shared MCP servers and shared models become **synapses** stretching between neurons
- 🌌 Flows cluster into **galaxies** — by provider, folder, or model — each with its own nebula and hue
- 🔍 Click any neuron and the camera **flies inside it**, revealing its internal nodes, prompts, and tool belt

*Inside a neuron: an orchestrator behaviour with its process nodes, three connected abilities, and the three behaviours it calls.*
</div>

## 👁️ Watch it think — live

This is not a static picture. While a flow runs in FLUJO, brain rides its **server-sent event stream** and animates the execution as it happens:

- The running behaviour's neuron **wakes up** — brighter, whiter, swollen, pulsing
- Subflow calls **flash along their axons** the instant they fire
- Flip on **follow mode** and the camera chases the thought — flying to whatever behaviour is executing *right now*
- A "now thinking" strip names the running behaviour, its current node or tool call, and how many runs are live

New flow saved? New MCP server installed? A server drops its connection? The brain **rebuilds itself in seconds** — it polls FLUJO continuously and reflects every change. Nothing is cached to disk; what you see is what's running.

And when you want a word with it: hit **⏸ pause**. The heartbeat stops, every running flow freezes mid-thought, and an **AI input window** opens — talk directly to any behaviour, with all the others offered to it as tools it can call (each call runs live in the visualization). Type as fast as you like; messages queue and dispatch in order. Press resume and the mind picks up right where it left off.

## 🌱 Grow a brain — the wizard

Beyond visualizing one workspace, brain has a **lobby** where you grow entire autonomous minds — and the wizard is deliberately non-technical. Three questions, zero jargon:

<div align="center">
<img src="docs/shot-wizard.png" alt="The grow-a-brain wizard: choose where your brain thinks — on your computer, in your network, or online" width="100%" />
</div>

1. **Where should your brain think?** On your computer (free, private, via Ollama), on another machine in your network, or online with a paid provider (Anthropic, OpenAI, OpenRouter, …) — curated model picks with plain-language tiers, no model-ID archaeology.
2. **What is its life goal?** One sentence. This becomes the brain's reason to exist.
3. **How often should its heart beat?** A schedule that wakes the brain to pursue its goal.

Press grow, and the manager provisions everything: a fresh, fully isolated FLUJO instance, the model (pulled into Ollama if local), the brain-stem, the heartbeat — and the brain appears in the lobby, ready to open and watch.

## 🧬 The self-evolving brain

Every brain is born with a **brain-stem**: a root flow whose prompt is its life goal and whose mind is the model you chose. On every heartbeat it wakes up and *thinks* — using seven tools that brain itself serves to it over MCP:

|  | it can… | which means… |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 📋 | `list_behaviours` / `list_skills` | introspect what it already knows |
| 🧠 | `learn_behaviour` | **write new flows for itself** — LLM-generated, with its own model |
| ⚡ | `perform_behaviour` | execute anything it has learned |
| 🔧 | `learn_skill` | **install new MCP servers** from the registry — acquiring real-world tools at runtime |
| 🗑️ | `forget_behaviour` / `forget_skill` | prune what no longer serves the goal |

So a brain doesn't just run a workflow — it **grows its own**. It learns behaviours, acquires skills, performs them, and forgets what fails. And because the brain-stem runs inside FLUJO's own engine, *every act of self-modification animates live in the viewer*. You literally watch it learn.

Guardrails are enforced at a single choke point — brain's MCP server — not left to the model's good manners: a brain can never delete or overwrite its own brain-stem, `perform_behaviour` refuses recursion into the stem and carries a depth budget, and destructive verbs can require your approval.

## 🐳 One command to life

You need two things installed first — that's the entire prerequisite list:

| Prerequisite | Why | Where to get it |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Git** | clones this repository | [git-scm.com/downloads](https://git-scm.com/downloads) |
| **Docker Desktop** (Windows / macOS) or **Docker Engine + Compose plugin** (Linux) | runs the stack and isolates every brain | [docker.com/products/docker-desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/) · [Engine install docs](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) |

> 💡 On Windows, Docker Desktop runs on the WSL 2 backend — its installer sets that up for you. Before continuing, make sure Docker is actually **running**: `docker info` should print without errors (on Windows/macOS that means the Docker Desktop app is open).

Then:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/flujo-app/brain.git
cd brain
docker compose up
```

☕ **The first start takes a few minutes** — Docker builds the brain image and builds FLUJO from its GitHub repo. Skip the FLUJO build by pulling the prebuilt image first: `docker compose pull flujo`. Every start after the first takes seconds. When the log settles, open:

| | |
| --- | --- |
| 🧠 **brain** — lobby + viewer | [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080) |
| 🌊 **FLUJO** — flow editor | [http://localhost:4200](http://localhost:4200) |

Stop it with `docker compose down` — your brains survive in Docker volumes and wake up on the next `up`. And here's what you get:

```

```

**Isolation is the architecture, not an option.** Every brain you grow gets its **own FLUJO container** with its own named volumes — its own flows, its own MCP servers, its own memory. Spawned brains publish **zero ports**: they live on an internal Docker network and are reachable only through the manager's authenticated per-brain proxy. One brain cannot see, touch, or break another. Delete a brain and its container vanishes; its volumes survive unless you purge them.

> ⚠️ **Localhost only, by design.** FLUJO has no auth layer, and the manager holds the Docker socket. Every published port binds to `127.0.0.1`. Never expose this stack without your own authenticating reverse proxy — details in the [technical docs](docs/TECHNICAL.md#security-model).

### ⚡ Zero prerequisites? Use the installer

One line checks for Git and Docker (or Node.js), installs what's missing, clones brain, registers a global `brain` command, and starts everything:

**Windows** (PowerShell):

```powershell
irm https://raw.githubusercontent.com/flujo-app/brain/main/scripts/install.ps1 | iex
```

**macOS / Linux**:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/flujo-app/brain/main/scripts/install.sh | bash
```

The installer asks a handful of questions — Docker or standalone mode, where to install, desktop shortcut, start now? — and from then on, typing `brain` in any terminal brings the whole stack up. Re-running the installer **updates** an existing install. For unattended installs, drive it with environment variables (`BRAIN_MODE=docker|standalone`, `BRAIN_DIR`, `BRAIN_BRANCH`, `BRAIN_START=1`) — see [`scripts/install.ps1`](scripts/install.ps1) / [`scripts/install.sh`](scripts/install.sh).

Prefer a classic **setup.exe**? Grab `brain-setup.exe` from the [latest release](https://github.com/flujo-app/brain/releases/latest) — the same installer wrapped in a graphical wizard: it checks for Git and Docker Desktop (or Node.js), auto-installs whatever is missing, and asks the same questions as wizard pages. Re-running it updates the install too. Built from [`installer/brain-setup.iss`](installer/brain-setup.iss) by CI on every release tag.

## 🚀 Try it in 30 seconds

Already running FLUJO? No Docker needed — brain is a static site. All it takes is [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) ≥ 20 (and Git for the clone):

```bash
git clone https://github.com/flujo-app/brain.git
cd brain
npm install && npm run dev
```

Open the URL, and if FLUJO is at `localhost:4200`, the brain boots itself the moment it finds it. Not on 4200? Point it anywhere with `?flujo=<url>`. Weak GPU? There's a full **2D map renderer** (Canvas 2D, no shaders) that low-end machines get automatically.

### 🧍 Standalone mode (no Docker, one brain)

Want the full experience — same-origin proxy, live execution animation, brain-stem tools — without Docker? Same prerequisites as above (Node.js ≥ 20 + Git), then:

```bash
npm install && npm run standalone
```

One command, one brain, `http://localhost:8080`. (The installer above sets this mode up for you too — pick *standalone* when it asks, or set `BRAIN_MODE=standalone`.) The front door decides for you: if a FLUJO is already running on `localhost:4200`, you land **straight in the viewer** — no lobby detour. No FLUJO and no Docker? You get the lobby in adopt mode, where you can point brain at any FLUJO you start by hand. (Docker installed? Then the lobby stays the front door and can spawn brains as usual.)

## 🗺️ Where this is going

Birth and death animations for neurons, a **timeline scrubber** ("this brain at day 3"), approval gates rendered *inside* the visualization so a brain can ask permission before acting, and a multi-brain constellation view. The full plan — verified against FLUJO's actual API surface — is in [ROADMAP.md](ROADMAP.md).
